Identification results
======================

There are five key concepts related to identification results: |ResultManager| ,
|IdentResult|, |LineTable|, and |Identification| and fitting results. They
have the following relationship:

#. |ResultManager| provides an interface for loading |IdentResult| instances and
   fitting results.
#. |IdentResult| stores properties related to identification and consists of
   two |LineTable| instances.
#. |LineTable| stores line properties.
#. |Identification| is used to create |IdentResult| instances.
#. contain the outputs generated by optimizers. While the exact fields may vary
   depending on the optimizer used, the following fields are always included:

   * **'specie'**: Information of the species to generate the model spectrum.
   * **'freq'**: Frequencies to generate the model spectrum.
   * **'x'**: The best-fitting parameters.
   * **'T_pred'**: The best-fitting spectrum.
